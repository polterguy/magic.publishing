# Magic Publishing

Magic publishing is a CMS I created because WordPress domain abuse suspended my domain servergardens.com, and I realised WordPress could no
longer be trusted with our data. The CMS is built in .Net Core, and features some unique qualities - Among other things it allows for you to
return content as pure JSON objects, allowing you to build any type of frontend client you wish for it - Including for instance Android and
iPhone clients, to such create your own uniwue publishing platform, allowing users to use their clients of choice, while still leveraging the
same actual content and data.

It also allows you to create content using a Markdown editor, easily allowing you to apply formatting, with plugin support - And it gives you
a highly modern and rich dashboard to edit your content, and/or database records, configuring your system.

Basically, I realised the world needed a rich, modern, and high quality .Net Core based CMS system, allowing people to easily publish their content,
without fearing that some big Silicon Valley company was going to censor their content - Hence: **Magic Publishing**.
